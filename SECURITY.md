## Security Best Practices

When using this library:

1. **Validate Input:** Always validate content before compression
2. **Limit Payload Size:** Use `maxBytes` parameter to prevent memory exhaustion:
   ```php
   $builder = new CompressionBuilder(maxBytes: 10_485_760); // 10MB limit
   ```
3. **Check Algorithm Availability:** Verify extensions are loaded before compression:
   ```php
   if (AlgorithmEnum::Brotli->isAvailable()) {
       // Safe to use brotli
   }
   ```
4. **Handle Errors:** Always check compression results in production:
   ```php
   if ($result->isError()) {
       // Log error and fallback to uncompressed
   }
   ```

## Known Security Considerations

### Compression Bombs
This library includes built-in protection against decompression bombs through the `maxBytes` parameter. Always set appropriate limits for your use case.

### Algorithm Availability
The library gracefully handles missing PHP extensions. However, always verify algorithm availability in your deployment environment to avoid unexpected failures.
